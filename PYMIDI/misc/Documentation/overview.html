<h1>Overview of the PYMIDI Framework</h1>

<p>The PYMIDI Framework provides a set of classes and utility functions for
communicating via MIDI, both with physical devices (MIDI interfaces,
MIDI controllers, etc.) and with other MIDI software.</p>

<p>The framework is basically a wrapper around Apple's CoreMIDI framework,
although you don't need to understand CoreMIDI to use the basics of PYMIDI.
It provides a nicer Objective-C interface to basic CoreMIDI functionality
and provides some additional functionality that is very useful for producing consistent
and reliable handling of MIDI.  It does not attempt
to duplicate all of CoreMIDI's functionality in Objective-C; instead it allows
advanced developers to access the underlying CoreMIDI data structures.</p>

<p>The framework sends and receives MIDI data, but it doesn't take care
of parsing, processing or generating it.</p>
