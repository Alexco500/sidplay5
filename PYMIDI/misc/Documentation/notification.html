<h1>MIDI Setup Changes</h1>


<h2>Setup Change Notifications</h2>

<p>By registering with your application's default notification center
to receive the the <code>PYMIDISetupChanged</code> notification you
can be notified whenever any changes in the MIDI system take place.
These include:

<ul>
	<li>disconnection or connection of MIDI interfaces</li>
	<li>property changes on MIDI endpoints, including name changes</li>
	<li>creation of deletion of virtual endpoints by other applications</li>
</ul>

<p>Any changes that you make to MIDI endpoints will not cause a
<code>PYMIDISetupChanged</code> notification to take place within
your application.  You are responsible for handling these changes
yourself.</p>

<p>The following is a simple example of registering to receive
MIDI setup changed notifications:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]
	addObserver:self selector:@selector(midiSetupChanged:)
	name:@"PYMIDISetupChanged" object:nil
];
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h2>Offline Endpoints</h2>

<p>Removed devices will be marked as offline. The correspoing
endpoint will continue to exist but it's <code>isOffline</code>
method will return <code>YES</code>.  Should the device be
re-connected, the endpoint will once again be marked as online and
linked to the device.</p>

<p>PYMIDIEndpoint's <code>displayName</code> method will append
the string " (offline)" to the name of the endpoint when it's offline.</p>
