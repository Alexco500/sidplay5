<h1>Receiving MIDI Data</h1>

<p>To receive MIDI data from a real source (or virtual destination)
you must register yourself as receiver using the endpoint's
<code>addReceiver:</code> method.</p>

<p>Having done this, the endpoint will call the
<code>processMIDIPacketList:sender:</code> method of the receiver
whenever new MIDI data becomes available.</p>

<p>Call the endpoint's <code>removeReceiver:</code> method when you
no longer want to receive MIDI data.</p>

<p>The following shows the basics of receiving MIDI data:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
[myEndpoint addReceiver:self];

- (void)processMIDIPacketList:(MIDIPacketList*)myPacketList sender:(id)sender
{
    // Handle the MIDI data in here
}

[myEndpoint removeReceiver:self];
</pre>
</blockquote>
