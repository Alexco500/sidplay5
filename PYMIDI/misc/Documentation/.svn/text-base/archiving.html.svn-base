<h1>Archiving Endpoints</h1>

<p>Endpoints all conform to the <code>NSCoding</code> protocol
allowing them to be archived and unarchived using the standard
<code>NSKeyedArchiver</code> and <code>NSKeyedUnarchiver</code>.</p>

<p>Archiving an endpoint provides an easy way to save a user's
choice of source or destination endpoints to a document file or a
to an application's preferences.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to archive an endpoint:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
NSMutableData*   data;
NSKeyedArchiver* archiver;
    
data = [NSMutableData data];
archiver = [[NSKeyedArchiver alloc] initForWritingWithMutableData:data];

[archiver encodeObject:myEndpoint forKey:@"myEndpoint"];

[archiver finishEncoding];
[archiver release];
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The following example shows how to unarchive an endpoint:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
NSKeyedUnarchiver* unarchiver;
PYMIDIEndpoint*    myEndpoint;

unarchiver = [[NSKeyedUnarchiver alloc] initForReadingWithData:data];

myEndpoint = [[unarchiver decodeObjectForKey:@"myEndpoint"];

[unarchiver finishDecoding];
[unarchiver release];
</pre>
</blockquote>



<h2>Archiving Real Endpoints</h2>

<p>Archiving and unarchiving real endpoints is generally transparent.
Real endpoints are not actually created on unarchiving.  Instead, an
existing real endpoint that matches the archived endpoint is found
and returned by the unarchiver.</p>

<p>If the device corresponding to an endpoint is not available when
the endpoint is unarchived, an endpoint is created but is marked
as offline.  The endpoint will be reconnected with its device if the device
is later plugged in.</p>


<h2>Archiving Virtual Endpoints</h2>

<p>Unlike real endpoints, new virtual endpoints are created when
they are unarchived.</p>

<p>Often, for the purposes of undo or pasteboard handling, you
will need to archive references to endpoints and
have those existing endpoints found on unarchiving rather than having
new endpoints created.  To facilitate this, an object of the
<code>PYMIDIEndpointSet</code> class can be used as a delegate
for an <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code> or <code>NSKeyedUnarchiver</code>.
Any archived endpoints that appear in the set will be archived by
reference.  The same set can then be used when unarchiving to
find the matching existing endpoints.</p>
